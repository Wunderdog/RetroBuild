# RetroBuild

Is a simple build & export system for jars having other jars as dependencies. 
What Retrobuild does is:

1. Compiles sources

2. Expands 3rd party jars

3. Generates result jar from classes coming both from sources and external jars

Thus we have all the control for build and export process. 
* Fully debugable
* 100% Java
* No IDE depedendance
